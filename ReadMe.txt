Source Notes for PICkit(R) 2 Microcontroller Programmer PK2CMD Command Line Interface v1.20

Contains Device File V1.55.00 as
pk2cmd\release\PK2DeviceFile.dat

This source project can be opened and modified in Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express.

The included Source Guide is written more for the PICkit 2 Programmer GUI sofware, but generally applies to the PK2CMD source as well.  (Note that PK2CMD does not make any use the INI file described therein.)
NOTE: Descriptions in the Device File section regarding 9th config word support are not applicable to PK2CMD v1.20 as it does not yet support 9 configuration word devices.

This source is set up for Windows development of PK2CMD in Visual Studio, although all source files necessary for Linux and Mac OS builds are also included.  However, for building on these OS's it is recommended to download the v1.20 source titled specifically for them, as that archive contains a makefile and documentation specific to those Operating Systems.
